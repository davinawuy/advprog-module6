<h2> 1st Reflection </h2>

The function handle_connection will first take a TCP stream as an input. this represents an active connection from a web browser sending a HTTP request. Then it will wrap the incoming stream which has been set to mut or mutable with a buffered reader. This will buffer the input and should reduce the amount of system calls needed. Since the stream has been wrapped in a buffer it is possible to read the content per line using .lines() on the buffered reader. We then use `.map(|result| result.unwrap())` to unwrap everyting and handle the `Result` type. This is only possible if we assume reading all lines suceeded. We only ever stop reading based off `.take_while(|line| !line.is_empty())` which means we keep reading until there are no more lines to read so the of the end of the HTTP header section. Then use `.collect()` to gather all read lines and store it in a `Vec<String>` and finally print everything in a formatted print using `println!("Request: {:#?}", http_request);`.
